You have been assigned to a moon\nspace station, the center of controversy throughout the galaxy.\nMaintenance personnel have noticed that several workstations have been acting up, but have assured the\nengineering team that “uh, everything’s perfectly all right now”. You, however, suspect something\nsinister afoot. Could it be sabotage from the Underdog Rebels?\nYou know that a document for the space station was recently stolen (many Non-Copyrighted Alien spies\ndied), in which several attacks taking advantage of design flaws have been documented. Each attack\nrequires compromising a combination of components, distributed across the workstations.\nWhile you can not dismantle the workstations to directly inspect the components, you can send a team of\ndiagnosis droids to make observations on the workstations to exactly determine the faulty components. As\nyou perform diagnosis on each workstation, you can update the odds on which type of attack will occur.\nYou must do this in a timely manner, so that you can escape before an attack if necessary, and warn the\nBig Bad Guy Wearing Black if time permits.\n\n\n### Temporal Planning and Reasoning\nIn this task, you will be asked to check whether you have time to warn the Big Bad Guy Wearing Black,\nor whether you should just try to escape. You will be given duration information for traversals, diagnosis,\nand possible additional actions you might take, as well as timing constraints you must meet in order to\nescape on a shuttle or provide warnings. You will be asked to check for the feasibility of alternative plans,\nproviding a schedule for a feasible plan, and provide an explanation for each infeasible plan.\n\nInputs:\n\n1.

Now we check whether it satisifies all the other constraints. \nNotice that we have a constraint from A to E which should be in \\[0,60\\], and in our current solution it is $$t_E-t_A=80$$, \nthus our random assignment is not satisfiable, and we need to start over to keep guessing until we find one that satisfies all the other constraints.\n\nThis seems like an endless guessing, and by simulation we show that it is indeed not that promising.

We are using it to detect negative cycles in our constraint graph, because a negative cycle would mean our defined constraints are inconsistent with each other. \n\nThe key idea of Bellman-Ford is that we keep track of the shortest known distance between the start node and every node so far, and iterate through every edge to update those shortest distances every round. We do |V|-1 rounds total to guarantee that we have found the shortest path from the start node to every node because there are |V| number of nodes total. That is a fact of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. By running another round of the whole Bellman-Ford algorithm, if the distance to a node in the graph can be further reduced, we know we have a negative cycle because the first round of Bellman-Ford should've found all shortest paths from the single source already. Therefore the consistency check for the constraint graph is done by running Bellman-Ford twice for a total of O(|V||E|) time complexity.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"i_J8im-lG9QC","cell_id":"00008-a2954203-8a58-46f0-8314-10b552340cf4","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"code","id":"ue6qgWLb56fQ","cell_id":"00009-d450bb81-70f8-427f-bf61-d292f7449175","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"e083734c","execution_millis":10,"execution_start":1605877505940},"source":"import string\ndef bellman_ford(graph, start_node):\n  '''\n  Params:\n    graph: An instance of the Graph class representing the distance graph\n    start_node: the letter node of the starting source node\n  Returns:\n    Tuple (boolean, array): \n    where boolean is False if the graph has negative cycles, True otherwise\n    and where distance array D is such that \n    D[i] is the shortest distance from start_node to node i\n  '''\n  # Approach Bellman Ford\n  num_nodes = len(graph.nodes)\n  edges_list = graph.edge_list\n  st_idx = string.ascii_uppercase.index(start_node)\n  # D stores shortest distance from start node to every node in the graph\n  D = [float('inf')]*num_nodes\n  D[st_idx] = 0 #initialize distance to start node\n  #relax each edge num_nodes-1 times because we're guaranteed to find shortest path to all nodes after this many iterations\n  for i in range(num_nodes-1):\n    for edge in edges_list:\n      cost = edge.cost\n      fr_idx = string.ascii_uppercase.index(edge.fr)\n      to_idx = string.ascii_uppercase.index(edge.to)\n      if D[fr_idx] + cost < D[to_idx]:\n        # update D with shorter path if found\n        D[to_idx] = D[fr_idx] + cost\n  #at this point we've found shortest paths from start node to every other node in the graph\n  #UNLESS there's a negative cycle\n  #run another loop to detect if any edges can be relaxed.

To do this, we'll want to identify the shortest possible path between every pair of nodes (i.e. solve the \"all pairs shortest path\" (APSP) problem). \n\n\nThe APSP problem can be solved using the Floyd-Warshall or Johnson algorithm. Floyd-Warshall requires first editing the distance-graph with weights of 0 for edges connecting nodes to themselves, and with weights of +inf (or some very large number) for edges that do not exist (i.e. for nodes that are not connected). Once this edited distance graph is created, F-W works by checking all possible paths from one node to another, and recording the path that has the lowest cost. Since F-W requires checking all V^2 posible combinations of nodes, and requires checking all V possible paths connecting the two nodes, F-W has complexity that is O(V^3). This makes computational cost increase substantially with an increase in the number of nodes (vertices). In contrast, Johnson's algorithm is O(V^2\\log V + VE), and is better suited for sparse graphs.
