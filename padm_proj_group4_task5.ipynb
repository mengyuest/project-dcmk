You have been assigned to a moon\nspace station, the center of controversy throughout the galaxy.\nMaintenance personnel have noticed that several workstations have been acting up, but have assured the\nengineering team that “uh, everything’s perfectly all right now”. You, however, suspect something\nsinister afoot. Could it be sabotage from the Underdog Rebels?\nYou know that a document for the space station was recently stolen (many Non-Copyrighted Alien spies\ndied), in which several attacks taking advantage of design flaws have been documented. Each attack\nrequires compromising a combination of components, distributed across the workstations.\nWhile you can not dismantle the workstations to directly inspect the components, you can send a team of\ndiagnosis droids to make observations on the workstations to exactly determine the faulty components. As\nyou perform diagnosis on each workstation, you can update the odds on which type of attack will occur.\nYou must do this in a timely manner, so that you can escape before an attack if necessary, and warn the\nBig Bad Guy Wearing Black if time permits.\n\n\n### Temporal Planning and Reasoning\nIn this task, you will be asked to check whether you have time to warn the Big Bad Guy Wearing Black,\nor whether you should just try to escape. You will be given duration information for traversals, diagnosis,\nand possible additional actions you might take, as well as timing constraints you must meet in order to\nescape on a shuttle or provide warnings. You will be asked to check for the feasibility of alternative plans,\nproviding a schedule for a feasible plan, and provide an explanation for each infeasible plan.\n\nInputs:\n\n1. Set of possible actions\n2. Set of events\n3. Temporal constraints\n\nOutputs:\n\n1. Feasibility?\n2. Conflict if infeasible\n3. Schedule if feasible\n4. Best temporally feasible plan\n\n\n### Readings\nRepresenting temporal relations, Allen’s temporal algebra and simple temporal networks; temporal consistency, scheduling and dynamic execution. \n\nReading: \n\n* Dechter, Meiri and Pearl, “Temporal Constraint Networks,” – on\nStellar. \n* Optional Reading: Muscettola, Morris and Tsamardinos, “Reformulation Temporal Plans for Efficient\nExecution,” – on Stellar.","metadata":{"id":"fvA2D5-NOfYy","cell_id":"00003-4d79e072-dce3-4a00-a36b-e9b83ea685bc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Code Section\n\n1.

They left home at the same time and John arrived at work 10-20 minutes before Fred arrived. Then we will have the actions, events and constraints as following:\n\nActions: by car, by bus, by carpool, NULL (when no specific action is required)\n\nEvents: John left home, John arrived at work, Fred left home, Fred arrived at work\n\nConstraints: \n\n1. (John left home, John arrived at work, by car, 30, 40)\n2. (John left home, John arrived at work, by bus, 60, 100)\n3. (Fred left home, Fred arrived at work, by car, 20, 30)\n4.

(John arrived at work, Fred arrived at work, NULL, 10, 20)\n\nWe would like to generate graphs based on those inputs and to see what's the best scheduling. Notice that there are some pairs of events that can have multiple plausible actions (home->work, by bus/by car). \nFor each valid assignment of actions between events, we build a constraint graph (a directional graph), where the edge represents the time limit. For example, here we can choose \n(John left home, John arrived at work, by car, 30, 40), (Fred left home, Fred arrived at work, by car, 20, 30), (John left home, Fred left home, NULL, 0, 0) and \n(John arrived at work, Fred arrived at work, NULL, 10, 20) to build a graph.\n\n\nFor each graph we check the consistency, solve the D-graph and find the scheduling.\nFinally we compare all the possible schedulings and provide the best one.\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-52dd001f-91c5-426e-bfd5-bc602e1de43d"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dK81pgr42ZOf","cell_id":"00005-a076f919-0e08-4228-b407-38a8fb5e837c"},"source":"# necessary data structures for APSP representation\nclass Node:\n    pass\n\n\nclass Edge:\n    pass\n\n\nclass Graph:\n    pass\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Construct the Distance Graph\nGiven a list of actions, events, and constraints for a given constraint problem, builds the distance graph using the graph implementation defined above.
