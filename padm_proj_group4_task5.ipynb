You have been assigned to a moon\nspace station, the center of controversy throughout the galaxy.\nMaintenance personnel have noticed that several workstations have been acting up, but have assured the\nengineering team that “uh, everything’s perfectly all right now”. You, however, suspect something\nsinister afoot. Could it be sabotage from the Underdog Rebels?\nYou know that a document for the space station was recently stolen (many Non-Copyrighted Alien spies\ndied), in which several attacks taking advantage of design flaws have been documented. Each attack\nrequires compromising a combination of components, distributed across the workstations.\nWhile you can not dismantle the workstations to directly inspect the components, you can send a team of\ndiagnosis droids to make observations on the workstations to exactly determine the faulty components. As\nyou perform diagnosis on each workstation, you can update the odds on which type of attack will occur.\nYou must do this in a timely manner, so that you can escape before an attack if necessary, and warn the\nBig Bad Guy Wearing Black if time permits.\n\n\n### Temporal Planning and Reasoning\nIn this task, you will be asked to check whether you have time to warn the Big Bad Guy Wearing Black,\nor whether you should just try to escape. You will be given duration information for traversals, diagnosis,\nand possible additional actions you might take, as well as timing constraints you must meet in order to\nescape on a shuttle or provide warnings. You will be asked to check for the feasibility of alternative plans,\nproviding a schedule for a feasible plan, and provide an explanation for each infeasible plan.\n\nInputs:\n\n1.

This can either be done after making the distance graph or after creating the d-graph, but to avoid longer runtimes when there is an inconsistency, we'll do the check before making the d-graph. This will be done using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds single-source shortest paths. We are using it to detect negative cycles in our constraint graph, because a negative cycle would mean our defined constraints are inconsistent with eachother. \n\nThe key idea of Bellman-Ford is that we keep track of the shortest known distance between the start node and every node so far, and iterate through every edge to update those shortest distances every round. We do |V|-1 rounds total to guarantee that we have found the shortest path from the start node to every node because there are |V| number of nodes total. That is a fact of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. By running another round of the whole Bellman-Ford algorithm, if the distance to a node in the graph can be further reduced, we know we have a negative cycle because the first round of Bellman-Ford should've found all shortest paths from the single source already.
